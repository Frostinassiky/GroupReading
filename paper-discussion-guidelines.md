This document explains the goal and dynamic of IVUL paper discussion meeting. Please read the suggestions if you are interested in participating.

_Goal_

Gather to discuss the methodology or approach of a particular paper. This is also an excellent opportunity to practice soft-skills such as paper reading and paper summarization.

_Dynamic_

- Before the meeting

  One week before the meeting, a proponent proposes a pool of papers. All the attendees must pick and **read** one paper **before the meeting**.
- The day of the meeting

  A random person is selected as moderator to lead the discussion of the paper that she picks. More details below.

## Suggestions

### How to read a paper?
Take a look at [this suggestion](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).
If you do the second pass, we expect to have a great time (if the paper allows it).
Well written papers and well-trained readers, won’t require “an expert” to have a good discussion.

### Moderator role
- Her participation is limited to 10min. Her main role is to incentivize the discussion and manage interventions.
- What to do during the 10mins?
    - Tell us the answers for the [five C questions](http://ccr.sigcomm.org/online/files/p83-keshavA.pdf).
    - Tell us what you learn and what you find interesting.
    - Feel free to use the blackboard or YouTube videos (as long as it doesn’t consume the time for discussion).
- What to do on the next 30-45mins?
    - Open the discussion with parts that you did not understand.
    - Explain the paper for people that didn't read it. Don't take the burden, make use of people who read the paper.
    - Ask the proponent for departing words.

### Proponet role
- Read selected papers before the meeting.
This is your opportunity to make all the group read about topics that you consider relevant. Don’t waste it!
- Prepare a 5 mins intervention to explain your interest in both papers.
Explain the relevance of the paper in their field, etc.

## General rules
- This is a group activity. Be a good citizen; our attitude shows our commitment to the group.
- Take advantage of this opportunity to practice soft-skills. How to read a paper, how to ask questions, how to organize a panel.
- Research emerges from connecting dots far apart. If you read from other silos, the chances are that the dots won't be trivial to join a.k.a incremental research. 
- The group reading is not going to solve your research. We better keep reading by ourselves outside of it as well.
